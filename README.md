*You are currently looking at the development branch of vlcj-player for vlcj-5.0.0, if you want a stable version of
vlcj-player that works with vlcj-4 you should switch to the
[vlcj-4.x branch](https://github.com/caprica/vlcj-player/tree/vlcj-4.x).*

vlcj-player
===========

The vlcj-player is a media player application built using vlcj with a Swing
rich-client user interface. 

The main goal of the project is to provide an extensive demo application 
showing how to build media players with vlcj, and to include as many features
of vlcj as possible.

Generally the vlcj-player tries to match the Qt interface of VLC with as many
of the same features implemented as possible.

However, it is not possible to get a 100% like-for-like implementation since
LibVLC, used by vlcj, exposes only a sub-set of the total functionality of VLC.

Status
------

This project is currently a work-in-progress.

If you execute "mvn install" or "mvn package", you will get a distribution
package that you can unpack. This will give you the vlcj-player application jar
and all of the dependencies - you can simply execute `java -jar vlcj-player-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`
and the application should start.

On the other hand, just run it from an Eclipse project.
